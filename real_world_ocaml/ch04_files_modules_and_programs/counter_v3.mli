type t
(** A collection of string frequency counts *)

val empty : t
(** The empty set of frequency counts *)

val touch : t -> string -> t
(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)

val to_list : t -> (string * int) list
(** Converts the set of frequency counts to an association list. A string shows up at most once, and
    the counts are >= 1. *)

(* Concrete Types in Signatures *)
(* Note that values (of which functions are an example) and types have distinct namespaces, so thereâ€™s no name clash here. *)

(** Represents the median computed from a set of strings. In the case where there is an even number
    of choices, the one before and after the median is returned. *)
type median = Median of string | Before_and_after of string * string

val median : t -> median
